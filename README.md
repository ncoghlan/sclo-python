I'm no longer using SCLs for anything, so this project isn't being actively developed.

# sclo-python
Rolling Software Collection for Python that tracks the latest upstream stable releases.

Current status: working through getting the new community SCL bootstrapped in the CentOS build infrastructure

Branches:

- EL7: https://github.com/ncoghlan/sclo-python/tree/sig-sclo7-sclo-python

Version: Python 3.5.3 (bootstrapping in progress)

Planned updates:
- Python 3.5.4 (expected late July/early August)
- Python 3.6.2 (not too long after 3.5.4)
